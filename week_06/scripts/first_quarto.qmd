## Introduction
This is my first *Quarto* document and I am going to plot some penguin data.

```{r}
#| message: False

#load libraries


library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## Look at the data
```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

## Make a plot
This is looking at the relationship between **bill length** and **bill depth**
```{r}
#| warning: false
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= bill_length_mm, y= bill_depth_mm, color= species))+
  geom_point()
```
